# Frequently Asked Questions


> UnaMKR vs UnaShield, which one is right for me?

UnaMKR and UnaShield have been designed for different purposes.

UnaMKR is great for:
* Traveling around the world in countries with different Sigfox Radio Configurations
* BLE beacon and scanner
* Running Ultra-low power consumption (below 10mA)
* Having most common environmental sensors all-in-1 board

UnaShield is great for:
* Single Sigfox Radio Configuration projects
* Using Grove sensors
* Using simple onboard sensors (Temperature, Humidity, Air Pressure, Accelerometer, Magnetometer, Push Button)

If you ask us, we love both :)


> Is UnaShield deprecated?

Of course, not!

UnaShield remains available (and is still great!).
